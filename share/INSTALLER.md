Welcome to the new PHPL Installer!

This installer will install or upgrade PHPL including modules and themes. If there are local changes to any of the themes, they should not be overwritten. It is still recommended that you copy the theme file when editing, and then edit the copy.

You will be prompted to configure your shell automatically. Currently bash and fish can be configured.
